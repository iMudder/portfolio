In your 'Portfolio' directory, create a directory called 'styles' and within it, first-stylesheet.css. In this stylesheet, write some styling for your portfolio site. This file have at least 50 lines of code. Use your awesome design skillz or just experiment. It's ok if the final product doesn't look beautiful- this assignment is about using CSS properly, not great design :) 

Include a link to the stylesheet in the head section of each of the html pages. This would also be a good opportunity to add more content to these HTML pages.

Use git to commit your work as you go. Create a second branch for your repository called 'gh-pages'. Push your work up to your Github repository's master and gh-pages branches (they should be the same), and submit a link to the Github repo for the assignment. I will view the pages via your personal gh-pages URL and expect everything to be functional (no broken images or links, etc). Refer to class 1's slides if you need a refresher on Git & Github, class 3's slides for how to work with branches, and this guide may help you with gh-pages (we're using "project pages"): http://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages
